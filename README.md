# Book Recommendation System - Streamlit Application

# Problem Statement:
Leverage neural networks to analyze and predict customer behavior, recommend books, and forecast demand in the publishing industry, improving both customer experience and sales.

This project is a Streamlit-based web application designed to recommend books and provide book-related details. It uses a machine learning model, a database, and Lottie animations for a user-friendly experience.

# Features

 1. Interactive User Interface: Navigate through pages with ease and search for books based on various criteria like Title, Author, Publisher Name, or Published Year.

 2. Machine Learning: Predict book genres using a pre-trained neural network.

 3. Database Integration: Fetch book details and recommendations from a local SQL database.

 4. Lottie Animations: Enhance the user experience with animated visual elements.

 5. Recommendations: Get related book suggestions based on predicted genres.

# Prerequisites

 1.Python 3.8+

 2. Required Python libraries:

 3. Streamlit (>=1.2.0)

 4. Pandas (>=1.3.0)

 5. SQLAlchemy (>=1.4.0)

 6. TensorFlow (>=2.6.0)

 7. Streamlit-Lottie (>=0.0.2)

 # Database:

 A Microsoft SQL Server database with a table named book_data.

 # Pre-trained files:

  1. book_genre_model.keras

  2. vectorizer.pkl

  3. label_binarizer.pkl

  4. Lottie animation JSON file: Animation.json

# Deep Learning Model Building

  1. Data Preparation:

     * Preprocess the book data (e.g., clean text, tokenize, and vectorize).

     * Encode the genres using a label binarizer.

  2. Model Architecture:
  3. Training: (train_test_split)
  4. Book Details and Recommendations
    * Creaste a def function to display the predicted Genres related Book details to fetch.
    * Fetches book details and related books based on genres.

#Setup Instructions

1 .Clone the Repository:
 git clone <repository-url>
 cd <repository-folder>

2. Install Dependencies:
  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Prepare the Database:

 1. Ensure your SQL Server database is set up and populated with book data in a table named book_data.

 2. Update the connection string in the get_db_connection() function with your database credentials.

4 .Place the Required Files:

 1. Save the pre-trained files (book_genre_model.keras, vectorizer.pkl, label_binarizer.pkl) in the project directory.

 2. Place the Lottie animation JSON file at the specified path (D:\Tools\VS Code\MDT35\Final_Project\Book_Recommendation_Project\Animation.json).

5. Run the Application:
  * streamlit run app.py

6. Access the Application:

  * Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501.

# File Descriptions

 1. app.py: Main application script.

 2. requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries.

 3. Animation.json: JSON file for Lottie animations.

# Code Overview

  def get_db_connection():
     engine = create_engine("mssql+pyodbc://sa:123@Sudhakar\\SQLEXPRESS01/Local_database?driver=ODBC+Driver+17+for+SQL+Server")
     return engine
 * Connects to the local SQL Server database.

# Genre Prediction

  single_input_tfidf = vectorizer.transform([single_input]).toarray()
  prediction = model.predict(single_input_tfidf)
  predicted_genre = label_binarizer.inverse_transform((prediction > 0.5).astype(int))

 * Prepares input, transforms it using a vectorizer, and predicts the genre using a trained model.

# Navigation and Pages

   1. Home Page: Displays a welcome message and an animation.

   2. Details Page: Allows users to search for books and view recommendations.

#AWS Deployment

  1. Create an EC2 Instance:
     
     1.Launch an Amazon EC2 instance with appropriate specifications (e.g., Ubuntu 20.04).

     2.Configure the security group to allow HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic.

  2.Install Dependencies:

   1.Install Python and required libraries on the EC2 instance.

   2. Transfer the project files using SCP or a similar tool.

  3.Setup Streamlit:

   1.Run the Streamlit application on a specific port (e.g., 8501).

   2. Use screen or tmux to keep the application running.

  4.Access the Application:

   1. Use the public IP of the EC2 instance to access the application via the browser.
   2. 
# Future Enhancements

   1. Add user authentication for personalized recommendations.

   2. Enable book uploads to update the database dynamically.

   3. Incorporate additional recommendation algorithms.

   4. Deploy the application as a scalable service using AWS Elastic Beanstalk or Kubernetes.
